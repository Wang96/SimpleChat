TODO:
Client
Spec says connectionClosed should shut down client. Reasonable to not do this, since client could try to connect to a different server.

jetport, get host, seaport are good

-2 in setHost, no need for doCommand!

-3 logoff: no need for ServerLogoffHandler - this can be done in server-side clientDisconnected method.  Why get host in catch clause??


Server
-5 closed attribute and all the methods using it should not be You have isListening in AbstractServer and this should be used for most of this.

-3 in HandleMessage - no check needed and no message “server is closed”
-3 Server should have ChatIF, not ServerConsole, so a GUI could be added later

serverStopped is only for appropriate messages - it is called when stopListening happens, so should not call stopListening

No need for EchoServer main - it is started by the ServerConsole
-3 ServerConsole should pass itself to the EchoServer constructor, which should take a ChatIF parameter

getport, seaport good

-3 ServerNotConnectedCommand should check no clients and not isListening

-3 start and stop should not have messages, these should be in serverStarted and serverStopped hook methods. Use isListening, not closed

-3 close and quit  must stop listening and close port, using server close method.

-9 did no override AbstractServer methods clientConnected, clientDisconnected and clientException as indicated in E49.
